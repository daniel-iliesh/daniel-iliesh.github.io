# Personal Porftolio Website

## Improvements:
- [x] Resume tailoring flow - first tailor then generate with different themes as you want (now its wasting time and resources to tailor the resume again if you just want to change the resume's theme)
- [ ] Have a preview of each theme - get them from the official `jsonresume.org/themes`
- [ ] Have a list of resumes that were generated last - publicly accessible with their links and other metadata like the theme and time it was generated, it should also have a type which can be `amazon` or `linkedin` or `jd` and have corresponding links to the job listing on these platforms (that i need to save too) - so if maybe a person looks for a resume and finds it on the list, they can download it
- [x] Add the posibility to edit the json resume and then generate a new resume with the modifications
- [ ] Add support for Amazon Jobs Link to be pasted and extracted to the n8n workflow https://www.amazon.jobs/en/jobs/3074198
