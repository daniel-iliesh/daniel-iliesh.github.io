## 3. HOURLY BILLING (For Specific Scenarios Only)

### When to Use Hourly
✅ **Ongoing maintenance** (bug fixes, small features)  
✅ **Unclear scope** (client figuring out requirements)  
✅ **Trial project** (new client testing you for 10-20 hours)  
✅ **Agency subcontracting** (they bill hourly, so do you)  

### Hourly Rate Structure

| Service Type | Rate | Minimum |
|--------------|------|---------|
| Standard hourly | €50/hour | 10 hours/week |
| Maintenance retainer | €800/month | 15 hours pre-paid |
| Rush/emergency work | €75/hour | 5 hours minimum |

### Protection Clauses for Hourly Work
1. **Weekly cap**: Maximum 40 hours/week unless approved
2. **Overtime approval**: All hours beyond estimate require written approval
3. **Time tracking**: Use Clockify/TMetric with client-facing reports
4. **Scope definition**: List what's included vs. what's billed separately

---

## 4. PRICING ADJUSTMENTS

### Premium Charges (Add to Base Price)

| Situation                                              | Adjustment |
| ------------------------------------------------------ | ---------- |
| Rush delivery (<2 weeks)                               | +20%       |
| Complex integrations (Stripe, payment gateways)        | +25-40%    |
| AI/ML features                                         | +30-50%    |
| Existing codebase (refactoring/debugging others' code) | +20%       |
| No wireframes/designs (you create from scratch)        | +15%       |

### Discounts (Reduce Base Price)

| Situation | Adjustment |
|-----------|------------|
| First 3 clients (portfolio building) | -15-20% |
| Long-term retainer (3+ months commitment) | -10% |
| Repeat client (3+ projects) | -10% |
| Equity deal (startup can't pay full cash) | -30-50% cash + equity |
| Flexible timeline (5+ weeks, no rush) | -10% |

---

## 5. PRICING CALCULATOR LOGIC

### Interactive Calculator Formula

**Base Price** = Project Type Base Rate

**Project Type Base Rates**:
- Landing Page: €1,500
- SaaS Dashboard: €4,500
- API/Backend: €3,000
- Full MVP: €12,000

**Complexity Multipliers**:
- Simple (basic features, standard flow): 0.8x
- Medium (moderate features, some custom logic): 1.0x
- Complex (advanced features, multiple integrations): 1.4x

**Timeline Multipliers**:
- Rush (1-2 weeks): 1.2x
- Standard (3-4 weeks): 1.0x
- Flexible (5+ weeks): 0.9x

**Final Price** = Base Price × Complexity × Timeline

**Example**:
- Project: SaaS Dashboard (€4,500 base)
- Complexity: Complex (1.4x)
- Timeline: Rush (1.2x)
- **Final**: €4,500 × 1.4 × 1.2 = **€7,560**

---

## 6. PRICING PRESENTATION STRATEGY

### Pricing Table Layout (3 Columns)

**Column Order**: Starter → Professional → Enterprise

**Visual Hierarchy**:
- Professional package = highlighted/featured (most popular badge)
- Larger font, border, or shadow effect
- Different background color

**Key Elements per Package**:
1. Package name
2. Price (large, bold)
3. Payment terms (one-time, 50/50, milestones)
4. Delivery timeline
5. Feature list (8-10 bullet points)
6. "Best for" tag (target audience)
7. CTA button ("Get Started" / "Contact Sales")

### Pricing Calculator Components

**Step 1**: Project type selection (4 buttons: Landing Page, Dashboard, API, MVP)

**Step 2**: Complexity slider (Simple → Medium → Complex)

**Step 3**: Timeline dropdown (Rush, Standard, Flexible)

**Output**:
- Total estimated price (large, prominent)
- Price breakdown (base + adjustments)
- "Request Detailed Quote" CTA button
- Disclaimer: "Final price determined after scope discussion"

---

## 7. FIXED-PRICE VS. HOURLY: WHEN TO USE

### Use FIXED-PRICE When:

✅ Scope is 100% clear (wireframes, feature list, timeline defined)  
✅ Standard project type (landing page, blog, e-commerce)  
✅ You've done similar projects before  
✅ Client wants cost predictability  
✅ Project < 8 weeks duration  

**Your advantage**: Work efficiently = higher effective rate

**Example**: €4,500 project in 40 hours = €112.50/hour effective rate

---

### Use HOURLY When:

✅ Scope is unclear or evolving ("figure it out as we go")  
✅ Maintenance/support (unpredictable bugs, ad-hoc requests)  
✅ Long-term ongoing work (20+ hours/week for months)  
✅ New client testing you (10-20 hour trial)  
✅ Agency/subcontractor work (they bill hourly upstream)  

**Your protection**: Weekly caps + approval for overages

---

### Hybrid Model (RECOMMENDED)

**Structure**: Fixed-price base + hourly overage clause

**Contract Language**:
> "This proposal covers the following features: [detailed list]. Any additional features beyond this scope will be quoted separately at €50/hour with written approval required before work begins."

**Why this works**:
- Client gets cost predictability
- You're protected from scope creep
- Both parties aligned on boundaries

---

## 8. VALUE-BASED POSITIONING

### Don't Say (Commodity):
- "I'm a full-stack developer"
- "I know React, Vue, Node, etc."
- "I charge €40/hour"

### Say Instead (Specialist):
- "I build SaaS dashboards and scalable APIs for early-stage startups"
- "I specialize in Vue.js + Node.js + Go for fast MVP development"
- "I help startups launch in 2-4 weeks with fixed-price packages"

### Portfolio Headline Examples:
- "Full-Stack Developer | SaaS Dashboards & APIs | Vue.js · Node.js · Go"
- "I help startups build MVPs in 2-4 weeks | Fixed-price, predictable delivery"
- "Specializing in SaaS products for early-stage startups | 3+ years experience"

---

## 9. TARGET CLIENT BREAKDOWN

### Who Hires Contractors Most?

| Client Type | Frequency | What They Hire For | Priority |
|-------------|-----------|-------------------|----------|
| Early-stage startups (pre-Series A) | 85-90% | MVP, features, tech setup | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ TOP |
| Agencies (digital, dev shops) | 90%+ | White-label, overflow work | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ |
| Scale-ups (Series A-C) | 60-70% | Features, capacity, specialists | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ |
| SMBs (small/medium businesses) | 50-60% | Websites, tools, maintenance | ⭐⭐⭐ |
| Enterprises (Fortune 500) | 20-30% | Niche projects | ⭐ AVOID |

**Focus**: Startups + Agencies = fastest hiring, highest volume

---

## 10. MOST HIRED PROJECT TYPES (By Frequency)

Based on 1,400+ Upwork projects analyzed:

## 16. FINAL PRICING STRATEGY SUMMARY

### Your Positioning
**"Full-Stack Developer specializing in SaaS dashboards and APIs for early-stage startups. Vue.js · Node.js · Go. Fixed-price packages for predictable delivery."**

- **Hourly**: €50-60/hour (maintenance, unclear scope only)
- **Landing Page**: €1,500 (1-2 weeks)
- **SaaS Dashboard**: €4,500 (3-4 weeks)
- **Full MVP**: €12,000 (6-8 weeks)

### Your Competitive Advantages

✅ Get 50% upfront for all projects  
✅ Use hybrid model (fixed + hourly overage clause)
